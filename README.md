# Dero's Ultimate Remix

Why do I do this to myself? Modding is hard and I'm bad at Rust. Unfortunately, funny hitbox go brrr so here we are.

No that's actually all I have to say it's 3:02 a.m. as of writing this and I ain't revising it brother. ðŸ¦…

## Changelog I guess:
  - Ganon
    -  Grounded Wizard's Foot now goes farther.
    -  Aerial Wizard's Foot now resembles Wizard's Dropkick, the custom special move from Sm4sh.
    -  Wizard's Foot now has a reflector property to help Ganondorf's approach game. 
  - Jigglypuff
    -  Sing actually put airborne opponents to sleep.
## Todo:
  - Jigglypuff
  -   Give Jigglypuff a better neutral special.
  - Ganondorf
  -   Buff Warlock Punch.
  - Sonic:
    - Replace Spin Dash with Flame Shield.
      - Simply shoots forward like Fox Illusion, but gives Sonic an "ember" charge.
        - When Sonic has an ember, he can cancel any aerial into a slightly weaker version of Flame Shield.
    - Replace Spin Charge with the Bubble Shield.
      - When used, grants Sonic the Bubble Shield.
        - This charge will passively grant him super armor with 40 HP (Once the armor has taken 40 damage, it breaks.)
        - If Down Special is inputted with the Bubble Shield active it will perform an attack:
          - If grounded when using the Bubble Shield Attack, idk
          - If airborne, you will plummet to the ground with a shockwave, launching enemies at a low, horizontal angle.
    - Forward Aerial will be replaced with the Sonic Eagle, using Snake's Forward Aerial animation.
    - Spin Charge will be moved to Sonic's neutral special, removing Homing Attack.
