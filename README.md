# Dero's Ultimate Remix

Why do I do this to myself? Modding is hard and I'm bad at Rust. Unfortunately, funny hitbox go brrr so here we are.

No that's actually all I have to say it's 3:02 a.m. as of writing this and I ain't revising it brother. ðŸ¦…

## Changelog I guess:
  ## Ganon
    -  Grounded Wizard's Foot now goes farther.
    -  Aerial Wizard's Foot now resembles Wizard's Dropkick, the custom special move from Sm4sh.
    -  Wizard's Foot now has a reflector property to help Ganondorf's approach game. 
  ## Jigglypuff
    -  Sing actually put airborne opponents to sleep.
    -  Aerial Rest spikes.
